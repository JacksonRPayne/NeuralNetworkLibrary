# NeuralNetworkLibrary
A library of neural net tools I created in python and numpy along with a project demonstrating the use of it

# Features
The neuralnetwork.py file provides 
1) A way to create a trainable feed forward neural network with any number of layers, each 
layer having any number of nodes.
2) A trainStochastically method which provides a gradient descent algorithm to train the network on
any input and output. 

The XOR.py file provides example usage of the neural network class, by training a simple neural net to
simulate an XOR gate.
